Extends the standard WordPress widgets to be able to run on another blog on the site.
== Description ==
This plugin is only supported on PHP 5.2 or greater.

<!--description-->
MUWidgets adds widgets to extend the standard WordPress widgets to be able to run as if on another site on the Multisite installation.

You now have a number of new widgets prefixed with the word 'Site' that operate the same as the standard WordPress plugins, just with the addition of a 'Site' option in the setup.
You are able to select any Site on the Multisite installation that you have administration access to.
 Just select the site and click 'save' now the widget is operating as if it was on the other site, enabling you to display for example the blogroll or recent posts from the main blog.
